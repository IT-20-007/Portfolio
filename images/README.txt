PLACEHOLDER IMAGES

For a complete portfolio website, you need to replace these placeholder instructions with actual images:

1. about.jpg - A professional image for your About section (recommended size: 800x500px)
   - Consider using a clean workspace photo, a picture of your setup, or a relevant industry image
   - Choose something that represents your professional identity and field of work
   - Avoid selfies or casual photos; maintain a professional aesthetic

2. project1.jpg through project6.jpg - Images for your projects (recommended size: 800x600px)

You can find free stock images at:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
- Pexels (https://pexels.com)
- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com)

Or use your own project screenshots and professional photos.

Image Optimization Tips:
- Compress your images to reduce file size
- Use JPG for photographs and PNG for images with transparency
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for optimal loading speed
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for project images
